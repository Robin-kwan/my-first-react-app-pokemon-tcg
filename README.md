# Instruction

The first time setup, use `npm install`

To run the app, use `npm start` and it should appear on `http://localhost:3000/`

**Note** If any api issue occurs, please revert `PokemonTCG` to v1.3.2 by `npm install --save pokemon-tcg-sdk-typescript@1.3.2` as it's the most compatible version at the time.
